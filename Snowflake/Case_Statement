-- The CASE statement allows you to perform an IF-THEN-ELSE check within an SQL statement.

/* It’s good for displaying a value in the SELECT query based on logic that you have defined. 
   As the data for columns can vary from row to row, using a CASE SQL expression can help make your data more readable and useful to the user or to the application. "*/

-- It’s quite common if you’re writing complicated queries or doing any kind of ETL work.

-- SYNTAX
/* The syntax of the SQL CASE expression is:

CASE [expression]
WHEN condition_1 THEN result_1
WHEN condition_2 THEN result_2 ...
WHEN condition_n THEN result_n
ELSE result
END case_name 
*/

/*
The CASE statement and comparison operator
In this format of a CASE statement in SQL, we can evaluate a condition using comparison operators. Once this condition is satisfied, we get an expression from corresponding THEN in the output.
Suppose we have a salary band for each designation. 
If employee salary is in between a particular range, 
we want to get designation using a Case statement.

In the following query, we are using a comparison operator and evaluate an expression.

For Male employee, we should get employee salaries in ascending order
We can define this condition with a combination of Order by and Case statement.

1. Low-Level Question: Categorize Sales Amounts
Scenario: You need to categorize sales into three types based on the total sale_amount:

"Low-Value" for sales amount less than or equal to $100.
"Medium-Value" for sales amount between $101 and $500.
"High-Value" for sales amount greater than $500.

2. Medium-Low Question: Determine Discount Eligibility

SQL Query:

       CASE
           WHEN quantity_sold > 10 THEN sale_amount * 0.90  -- Apply 10% discount
